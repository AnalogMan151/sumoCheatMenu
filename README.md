# Pokémon Sun & Moon Cheat Plugin
## A cheats plugin for NTR CFW

A plugin created using [@RyDog199](https://github.com/RyDog199/)'s [blankCheatMenu](https://github.com/RyDog199/blankCheatMenu) base which in turn was based off [@Nanquitas](https://github.com/Nanquitas/) work.

To compile you'll need DevKitARM (from DevKitPro) and Python2.

To run you'll need a 3DS, Custom Firmware, and BootNTR Selector. Start BootNTR Selector BootNTR Selector Mode-3 for o3DS) to load NTR and then start the game. Activate by pressing SELECT in game. This plugin supports both version 1.0 and v1.1 of the games.

- Illegal Cheats
  1. Catch Trial Pokémon

Previously I had removed any codes that could make illegal Pokémon that could not be traded or battled online. I have decided to add these codes in but with a large disclaimer. The Spawner code can make legal Pokémon if attention is taken to location, level, and form of spawned Pokémon.

This is a work in progress and a learning exercise. The GateShark cheats these codes were derived from can be found in the resources folder.
